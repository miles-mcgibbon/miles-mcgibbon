# About Me

I am a self-taught programmer and MSc Bioinformatics student at The University of Edinburgh. I am currently working on several *in silico* drug discovery projects alongside my masters involving the use of machine learning to characterise protein-ligand binding interactions at the SMVDGroup - [smvdgroup.github.io](https://smvdgroup.github.io) - a research group of which I am a co-founder.
